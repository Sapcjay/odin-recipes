            <li>1 cup drained, diced tomatoes (from a 15-ounce can)
            <li>2 thyme sprigs
            <li>1 bay leaf
            <li>1/2 teaspoon hot sauce, plus more for serving
            <li>Salt and freshly ground pepper
            <li>2 dozen littleneck clams, scrubbed

        </ul>
    </p>
        <h3>Instruction</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Heat olive oil in a large soup pot. Add shallot and garlic and cook over high heat, stirring, until softened, about 3 minutes. Add wine and boil until reduced by half, about 3 minutes. Add stock, clam juice, tomatoes, thyme, bay leaf, and hot sauce and season with salt and pepper. Bring to a boil over high heat and cook until slightly reduced, about 10 minutes.</li>
            <li>Add clams, cover and cook just until most of them open, about 5 minutes. Add snapper and shrimp, cover and simmer until they are cooked through and remaining clams have opened, 2 to 3 minutes. Using a slotted spoon, transfer seafood to 4 bowls. Add butter and parsley and cook over moderate heat for 1 minute, swirling pan. Spoon broth over seafood and serve with sourdough toast.</li>
        </ol>
