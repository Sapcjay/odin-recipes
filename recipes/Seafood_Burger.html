            <em>Let’s get together and have a sassy Shrimp Burger! Crisp outside, tender inside, and lightly spiced, these healthy seafood burgers hold together on the grill and bring welcome variety to your typical cookout menu. </em>
        </h2>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Shrimp. Shrimp’s structure and texture make it ideal for creating seafood burgers that hold together on the grill.
            <li>Dijon Mustard. To wake up the shrimp and give the burgers some zip. I use ALDI’s own brand, Burman’s. (Dijon is also the flavor punch in another seafood favorite, Crab Salad.
            <li>Green Onions + Parsley. For a touch of freshness.
            <li>Bell Pepper. A colorful red bell pepper complements the seasonings and sneaks in veggies too.
            <li>Southern-Inspired Spices. Paprika, seafood seasoning, and a pinch of cayenne give a nod to the classic shrimp po’boy.</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
        <h3>Instruction</h3>
