        <h3>Instruction</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Place the crabs in a basin and cover it with wet cloth. Place it in the freezer for 10-15 minutes. Take them out of the freezer and turn the crab upside down. Peel the triangular cap back and pierce a knife through directly at the tip of the triangle. Remove the triangular cap completely and scrub and rinse the shell.</li>
            <li>Scrub and rinse the mussels/clams and remove the beard if any.</li>
            <li>Cut off the mustache and legs of shrimp if any and rinse.</li>
            <li>Fill a large pot with 6 cups of water and bring it to a rolling boil. Add the baby potatoes and cook for 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>Add the corn, crabs, mussels/clams, shrimp and 4 lemon wedges,. Add a tablespoon of salt . Cover and cook for another 3 minutes or until all shellfish turn red/orange. Remove the crabs, shrimp, and mussels/clams, and corn from the water. Check if potatoes are cooked through by poking a toothpick through the center and it should go through easily. If not cook them further then remove from water.</li>
            <li>While seafood is cooking, in a large, deep pan or pot, heat the oil and butter over medium heat. Add the minced garlic and cook just until limp and aromatic. Don’t let the garlic brown.</li>
            <li>Add the cajun seasoning, lemon juice, and sugar and stir well. Cook for 2 minutes. Add the squid rings and cook for a minute then add the rest of the seafood, lemon wedges, corn and potatoes. Season with salt if needed. Cook for a minute more then turn off the heat.</li>
            <li>Transfer to a large serving container or serve directly on top of rice, boodle-fight style.</li>
        </ol>
